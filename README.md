# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to predict whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, sex, and class.

The Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers such as age, sex, passenger class (Pclass), and survival status, is used to build a predictive model. This project aims to implement a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival outcomes and evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.

In this project, a prediction model was created using the Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn library. The model was developed with the following steps:

Loading the necessary libraries and data.

Preprocessing the data (filling missing values, coding categorical variables, etc.).

The decision tree model was trained.

Survival statuses were estimated on the training data.


#Results
The model was able to achieve a high level of accuracy with a final score of 82% by effectively using both numerical and categorical features in predicting passenger survival.

The Decision Tree Classifier model developed within this project provides a good starting model for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. The model can be improved using more advanced algorithms (e.g. Random Forests or Gradient Boosting).

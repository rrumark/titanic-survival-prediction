# titanic-survival-prediction
This project analyzes the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to predict whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, sex, and class.

The Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers such as age, sex, passenger class (Pclass), and survival status, is used to build a predictive model. This project aims to implement a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival outcomes and evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
